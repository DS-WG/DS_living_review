#  **A Living Review of Darkshowers**

*Darkshowers sit at a rich intersection of theory, phenomenology and experimental efforts. They connect different areas of theoretical physics with each other and arise from well motivated theoretical scenarios. Below is a list of papers concerning darkshowers.*

The purpose of this note is to collect references for darkshowers.
