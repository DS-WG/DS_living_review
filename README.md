#  **A Living Review of Darkshowers**

*Darkshowers sit at a rich intersection of theory, phenomenology and experimental efforts. They connect different areas of theoretical physics with each other and arise from well motivated theoretical scenarios. Below is a list of papers concerning darkshowers.*

The purpose of this note is to collect references for darkshowers. A minimal number of categories is chosen in order to be as useful as possible. Note that papers may be referenced in more than one category. The fact that a paper is listed in this document does not endorse or validate its content - that is for the community (and for peer-review) to decide. Furthermore, the classification here is a best attempt and may have flaws - please let us know if (a) we have missed a paper you think should be included, (b) a paper has been misclassified, or (c) a citation for a paper is not correct or if the journal information is now available. In order to be as useful as possible, this document will continue to evolve so please check back before you write your next paper. If you find this review helpful, please consider citing it.
